```ðŸ“š October 1, 2022 by Julian Taglarini```

### INTRODUCTION

K-Means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms to form clusters of data based on the similarity between data instances.

### MOTIVATION
As I worked in a food proccessing and distribution company, I witness how often sales representatives use to group their clients pre sale visit based on their experience transformed into parameters like the day of the week when they are visited, sales volume, knowledge or "friendship" with the owner and so on.

We will use k-Means a an analitical aproach to that question and to establish a ground from wich the sales teams could start and then enhance client grouping using other factors besides their geographical location.
